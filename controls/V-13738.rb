Benchmark: APACHE SERVER 2.2 for Unix
Status: Accepted

All directives specified in this STIG must be specifically set (i.e. the
server is not allowed to revert to programmed defaults for these directives).
Included files should be reviewed if they are used. Procedures for reviewing
included files are included in the overview document. The use of .htaccess
files are not authorized for use according to the STIG. However, if they are
used, there are procedures for reviewing them in the overview document. The
Web Policy STIG should be used in addition to the Apache Site and Server STIGs
in order to do a comprehensive web server review.

  desc "Buffer overflow attacks are carried out by a malicious attacker
  sending amounts of data that the web server cannot store in a given size
  buffer. The eventual overflow of this buffer can overwrite system memory.
  Subsequently an attacker may be able to elevate privileges and take control
  of the server. The NGINX directive ""client_header_buffer_size"" limits the
  buffer size for reading client request header thereby limiting the chances
  for a buffer overflow. "
