Benchmark: APACHE SERVER 2.2 for Unix
Status: Accepted

All directives specified in this STIG must be specifically set (i.e. the
server is not allowed to revert to programmed defaults for these directives).
Included files should be reviewed if they are used. Procedures for reviewing
included files are included in the overview document. The use of .htaccess
files are not authorized for use according to the STIG. However, if they are
used, there are procedures for reviewing them in the overview document. The
Web Policy STIG should be used in addition to the Apache Site and Server STIGs
in order to do a comprehensive web server review.

  be read by the anonymous user if special precautions are not taken. Such

  being executed and, as such, are useful to malicious users. Techniques and
  systems exist today that search web servers for such files and are able to
  exploit the information contained in them."

  the home directory of the web server, this is a finding.

  If files with these extensions are stored in a repository (not in the document
  root) as backups for the web server, this is a finding.

  If files with these extensions have no relationship with web activity, such as
  a backup batch file for operating system utility, and they are not accessible
  by the web application, this is not a finding.  "
